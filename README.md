# VISIOPE_project
The project that I intend to carry out aims to address the challenge of discriminating hand poses from images through the development of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Utilizing Python 3 and PyTorch framework, I propose to design and implement a GAN architecture that effectively discriminates between different hand poses.\\

The GAN architecture will have the discriminator component that will be fine-tuned to identify and analyze hand poses with high precision, and differentiate among a variety of hand poses captured in image data.\\

The focus on the discriminative capability of the network enables to concentrate on enhancing the accuracy and reliability of hand pose recognition, a critical task in applications such as gesture control interfaces, sign language translation, and augmented reality.\\

Methodologically, the project will follow a rigorous development process, beginning with the collection and preprocessing of a diverse dataset of hand images. The dataset will include a wide range of hand poses captured under different conditions to ensure robust model training, in order to focus on adapting and optimizing the discriminator component of the GAN.\\

Following the model's development, testing will be conducted to evaluate its performance, with a focus on accuracy and efficiency.
